# Sample Data

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/open-contracting/sample-data.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/open-contracting/sample-data)

This repository holds sample data represented using the the new [Open Contracting Data Standard](http://ocds.open-contracting.org/standard/)

It should contain data aligned with the current version of the standard. Data aligned with previous versions of the standard may be found on named branches.

Pointers to externally available example data are found in the sources.md file.

## Test that sample data validates

```
pip install jsonschema
./validate.sh
```

## Licences

Each directory has its own README documenting the data source. Please note that the data in each folder is licensed under the license of the original publisher, which is documented in the README in each folder.
